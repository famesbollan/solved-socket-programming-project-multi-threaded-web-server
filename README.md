Objective: In this project, we will study how to write socket programming. In addition, we also study a real-world protocol of HTTP.

Task: Develop a multi-threaded web server. You can develop your code in two stages. In the first stage, you simply display the contents of the HTTP request messages that your web server receives. After this is running properly, you will add the code to generate an appropriate response. The web server needs a log file to record statistics of the client requests. Each request corresponds to one line in the log. Write down client hostname/IP address, access time, requested file name and response type. Your webserver also needs to handle some simple errors, such as webpage not found. You may run the server on your own computer, using the IP address of 127.0.0.1. Define your own port number (donâ€™t use 80). A single thread webserver will get partial mark.




You can use either Java or C/C++. Your code should be commented appropriately. Include a READMET text file of how to compile and run your program.
